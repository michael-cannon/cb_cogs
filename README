GENERAL:
Cb_cogs is a basic library of additional desired code functions or classes
founds to speed up prototyping and development efforts by Peimic.

Upon updates and installs, cb_cogs is designed to overwrite itself everytime.
That way previous release errors are minimized. If you customize cb_cogs though,
then you'll lose your edits so be sure to backup those changes. Even better
submit them to cb_cogs@peimic.com for potential inclusion into the library.


WARNING:
Please don't delete the cb_cogs directory or else Peimic modules will fail
to work.


REGARDS:
Thank you for using a Peimic module. Please send questions, comments, and
concerns to michael@peimic.com.
